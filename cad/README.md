# Plate files

In version v0.1 and v0.2, the right thumb cluster is not at the exact same place as the left one. It should be corrected in v0.3.

You can find here some plates for the keyboard:
 * svg are seen from the top
 * stl are seen from the bottom, to have the visible side on the bed of a 3D printer.
 
The scad file is the source of these files. You can tune it to change, for example, the swich hole size, depending on the tolerance you need.
